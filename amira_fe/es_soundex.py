def spanish_soundex(*, s: str) -> str | None:
    """Encode a Spanish word using a modified Soundex algorithm.

    Adapted from jellyfish's soundex function with modifications based on research
    papers for Spanish phonetic encoding. Unlike traditional Soundex, this returns
    a variable-length string of numbers rather than a fixed-length alphanumeric code.

    The algorithm handles Spanish-specific phonetic patterns:
    - Double letters (RR, LL) are normalized to single letters
    - Phonetically similar letters are grouped and encoded with the same digit
    - Returns numeric encoding rather than traditional Soundex format

    Based on research from:
    - https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2016/62277/62277.pdf
    - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285589803_Comparison_of_a_Modified_Spanish_Phonetic_Soundex_and_Phonex_coding_functions_during_data_matching_process
    - http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rium/v11n20/v11n20a11.pdf

    Args:
        s: Spanish word to encode. Should be normalized before calling.

    Returns:
        Phonetic encoding as a string of numbers, or None if word cannot be encoded.
