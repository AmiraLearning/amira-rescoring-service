### High-signal findings

- Critical: async blocking in phrase slicing
  - `utils/phrase_slicing.py`: `reconstitute_and_save_phrase(...)` is synchronous and called directly inside the async `process_activity_into_phrase_sliced_audio(...)`. It performs CPU work and `subprocess.run`, which blocks the event loop.
  - Fix: wrap the entire call in `await asyncio.to_thread(reconstitute_and_save_phrase, ...)` or switch to `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for ffmpeg and run the function off-thread.

- S3 streaming body not explicitly closed
  - `infra/s3_client.py`: after `get_object`, code reads `response["Body"]` to EOF but never calls `await body.close()`. While reading to EOF typically closes, explicit close prevents connection pool starvation under errors.
  - Fix: `try/finally: await body.close()` after the read loop, or use `async with` pattern if available.

- Cache race: engine double-create window
  - `src/pipeline/inference/engine.py:get_cached_engine(...)`: checks `if cache_key in _cached_engines` before acquiring the lock, then acquires the lock and checks/creates. Two threads can pass the first check and both create engines.
  - Fix: move the initial membership check inside the lock or use a single lock-guarded path.

- CUDA autocast dtype clarity
  - `src/pipeline/inference/engine.py:_run_model_inference(...)`: When `use_mixed_precision` but not `use_float16`, autocast runs with default dtype, which may be bf16 on some GPUs and fp16 on others.
  - Fix: decide a default (bf16 or fp16) per environment and document; optionally expose an explicit `autocast_dtype` config.

- JIT trace brittleness
  - `src/pipeline/inference/engine.py:_init_jit_trace`: `torch.jit.trace` with a fixed 16000-sample dummy can lock shapes; dynamic sequence models may require scripting or dynamic shapes.
  - Fix: add a config guard or dimension checks; fallback is already present, so at minimum document known safe settings.

- Global cache key composition edge cases
  - `src/pipeline/inference/engine.py:_make_cache_key`: the `hasattr(DeviceType, "CPU")` check is unnecessary and may mask future device variants; model path + dtype/compile/mixed flags should be sufficient.
  - Fix: simplify to `device_hint = w2v_config.device.value`.

- EMF metric robustness improved, but add dimensions consistency
  - Metric calls now guard exceptions. Ensure consistent dimensions across metrics (service, stage/device/model/correlation) as per your lower-priority TODO for dashboards.

- S3 list/head retries added; consider body-size backpressure
  - You have bounded semaphores for list/head/get and configurable buffer sizes. Consider adaptive buffer sizing for large objects or a cap on total in-flight bytes to avoid memory spikes when concurrency is high.

- Phrase slicing subprocess fallback path is still blocking
  - `utils/phrase_slicing.py`: the ffmpeg fallback re-encode path uses `subprocess.run` with potentially large payloads; if run frequently, prefer async subprocess or thread offloading (same item as the first bullet but specifically for the fallback path).

- Safe file cleaning
  - `utils/s3_audio_operations.py`: temp files are unlinked in finally; good. Mirror that explicit cleanup for every path that writes to `/tmp` in async contexts to prevent inode buildup on long runs.

- Triton HTTPS-only enforced
  - `src/pipeline/inference/triton_engine.py`: correctness check for https is good. If you expect internal ALB TLS termination with self-signed certs, consider a configurable CA bundle rather than disabling verification.

- Lambda/CPU quantization toggles
  - `src/pipeline/inference/engine.py:_init_device`: dynamic quantization guarded by `W2V2_QUANTIZE`. Consider exposing a minimum CPU-cores threshold (or model size threshold) to skip quantization when it regresses accuracy/throughput.

- Test coverage focus areas
  - Add tests around: decoder consecutive separators and empty segments; `s3_audio_operations.s3_find` parsing of keys; engine cache concurrency; robust mode token-skip warnings (you already planned these).

- Minor style/consistency
  - Ensure all public functions use keyword-only arguments; most do, but a few helpers are still positional.
  - Replace ad-hoc env parsing with small helpers where repeated (you started doing this in `infra/s3_client.py` config class; consider reusing for other env gates).

If you want, I can produce a short, prioritized edits list and diffs for:
- Making phrase slicing non-blocking in the event loop.
- Closing S3 streaming bodies explicitly.
- Locking the engine cache lookups to avoid double-create.

‚è∫ Comprehensive Code Audit Report

  Executive Summary

  I've completed a thorough audit of the Amira Letter Scoring codebase, a sophisticated audio
  processing and machine learning pipeline for speech recognition and phonetic analysis. The system
   processes audio files through AWS infrastructure using both CPU and GPU inference engines.

  Project Architecture Overview

  - Core Pipeline: Speech processing with Wav2Vec2 model and custom ASR alignment
  - Infrastructure: AWS-based with Lambda, SQS, S3, and Triton inference
  - Languages: Python (main), Rust (ASR aligner), TypeScript (CDK)
  - Dependencies: 27 main dependencies, well-managed with uv/pyproject.toml
